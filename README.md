Gerb.re
=======

**Gerb.re** is a collection of handy utilities and tools for geeks.

While this project is in heavy development for now, we have plans for the following tools:

* **gerbsverbs** - Create lorum ipsum texts bases on your own text patterns and a custom dictionary.
* **g3rbr3p@ss** - Handy tool for generating easily guesable, dictionary-based, l33t passwords.
* **gerbrepics** - Find a random suitable picture (as-a-service)
* **gerbresays** - Create a desktop wallpaper with post-its of random sayings.

All tools developed are either a web application or a webservice. We love the web!
